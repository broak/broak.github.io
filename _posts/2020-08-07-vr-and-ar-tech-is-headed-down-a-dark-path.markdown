Companies have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to stay profitable and continually grow. This fact in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing, however a combination of factors – business model, leadership, and morality – determine the externalities that will ultimately burden the public.

Right now, when the general public think of AR, they likely think of “Pokemon GO”. This isn’t surprising, given the clear absence of killer apps in the space. Even the latest iPad Pro, featuring a combination of computer vision and LIDAR, provides a merely *acceptable* level of presence with rudimentary scene recognition and object occlusion. And even then, the current hardware is at least a year ahead of meaningfully useful software. End users don’t care *how* their device does what it does, they only care whether what it does is valuable to them. But AR tech is moving quickly, and with companies like Facebook (with their Oculus division) and Apple investing vast amounts into this space, we’re going to see rapid developments unlike any seen since the first iPhone. Whether these developments end up being a net-positive or negative for our society is yet to be seen.

### Two competing business models

If you want to start a tech company, you have two business models to choose from: sell *products*, or sell *data*.

Selling products is hard — it is difficult to predict what people want. It’s even more difficult to navigate the geopolitical labyrinth required to produce these products cheaply, quickly and reliably at scale. But the biggest challenge is to keep the market coming back for more (or in [Juicero’s case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juicero), buying the damn thing in the first place).

Selling data is somewhat easier. What your publicly facing “product” actually *is* doesn’t matter, as long as you gather *behavioral data*. In the words of [Shoshana Zuboff](https://www.bookdepository.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Shoshana-Zuboff/9781781256855), users are the rocks from which the raw material of behavioral data is mined. The *real* products these companies sell are the prediction algorithms that are highly sought after by anyone looking to market a their new soft drink, diet fad or political ideology. The difficult thing in this case of these businesses, is *how do you keep people using* (and therefore providing data)? Here we see the [same techniques recycled time and time again](https://www.humanetech.com/what-we-do#problem) — never-ending scrolling feeds, strategic randomization, recommendation-algorithms, and more, all derived from psychological studies about addiction and eerily similar to the *[strategies used by the gambling industry.](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/)* The goal is to keep you scrolling, liking, commenting, subscribing and engaging — because *this is where the money is*.

As of today, augmented reality is essentially in its infancy. Neither business model has used this technology to its full potential, though both are well suited to. The most robust headset as of today is perhaps the Microsoft HoloLens 2 — a head-mounted display aimed at industry applications like construction and manufacturing, and sells very few units compared to traditionally consumer-focused products. Presumably, the high unit cost covers the R&D costs + manufacturing, logistics and profit (if any). This is essentially the first model — *selling a product*. An exemplary of this model is Apple, a company that repeatedly displays its aptitude at producing high-margin electronics, paired with frighteningly effective marketing that ensures each product (see: iPod, iPhone, iPad, AirPods, etc) become a middle-class staple and veritable status symbol. A successful AR headset using this model *will* be expensive. It *will* be highly sought after, but it *will* remain out of reach for many people — such is the fundamental downside of such a business model.

The alternative is a cheaper headset, one much more accessible to the vast majority of the public (especially in developing nations), where the costs are subsidized by the sheer amount of data they will collect. However, while the Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix apps on your phone may *infer* your preferences, dislikes and motivations from what you tap, swipe and hover over, AR and VR headsets are *fundamentally different*. A fully featured headset will [track your gaze to ensure what you see is as realistic as possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveated_rendering), likely also collecting information about your [pupil size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mydriasis) over time. It is not unreasonable to expect such a headset to connect to peripherals like your smartwatch which will gather periodic bio-metrics such as [heart rate](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/watch/apda88aefe4c/watchos), [blood pressure](https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/measure-bp-on-galaxy-watch-active/) or [galvanic skin response](https://www.wareable.com/health-and-wellbeing/zenta-vinaya-specs-price-features-release-date). Furthermore, an AR headset requires cameras facing *outwards* to be able to place virtual elements in space, and ensure they are coherent and aligned with your surroundings. This combination of technologies results in a device that can sample, at multiple times per second, your behavioral and physiological response to any naturalistic stimulus — or in layman’s terms, *read your thoughts about everything you see* *.

Let’s imagine you’ve got the latest set of smart glasses from Facebook.

Say you were wearing these glasses as you walked down an aisle of a store. Every subtle glance at an object would be recorded, quantified and correlated with your bio-metrics and past behavior. Stare at a pack of [Tim-Tams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tam) for a split-second longer than you otherwise would have, and the headset correlates that statistically significant increase in *gaze duration* with a simultaneous *micro-dilation of your pupils*, and tiny, but meaningful increases in *heart rate* and *skin conductivity*. A few short seconds later you get an AR notification of a discount on Tim-Tams if you scan your loyalty card at the checkout (yet another form of behavioral data collection). In essence, what we have is a *nightmarishly* effective tool for behavioral modification — [a task our smartphones currently serve](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-facebook-shoshana-zuboff), but on steroids.

### It’s going to happen whether we like it or not

I described these two alternative business models earlier as if they were somehow mutually exclusive — but we know this is not the case. The world we live in is rife with systemic inequalities and this is yet another example. Those fortunate enough to be able to afford the most expensive options are likely to own devices or subscribe to service tiers that provide increased privacy in the form of greatly reduced data collection and ad-targeting. You could buy an iPhone if you can afford the premium, or you can save money but accept Google’s default settings which keep track of your [location, browsing, search and messaging histories](https://www.wired.com/story/google-tracks-you-privacy/). You could pay a monthly fee for your apps, or instead use the free tier, which is paid for by tracking your searches and movements across the web, and targeting you with advertisements.

I’m not convinced that there is much we can do to ensure that such a future does not eventuate. We could forgo modern technology entirely, but that is becoming increasingly unrealistic. Our devices are gradually supplanting our wallets, car keys, ID’s and passports. They have already made themselves invaluable to those with disabilities, and have served to democratize access to information in underprivileged and marginalized populations. In ten to fifteen years, it might be more unusual to own a pair of glasses that *don’t* provide turn-by-turn navigation, automatic text translation and puppy face-filters.

At the end of the day, the companies in this space will do what is best for their shareholders, even if it means becoming ever more invasive.
