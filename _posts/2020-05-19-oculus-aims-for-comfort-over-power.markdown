This week Facebook [announced it would start accepting productivity apps in the Oculus store](https://www.oculus.com/blog/celebrating-the-one-year-anniversary-of-oculus-quest-and-rift-s/) for their popular Oculus Quest virtual reality headset. Until now, their store has primarily served games and video-streaming applications, but their latest announcement points to some of their broader goals — a push for their flavor of VR to be *the next computing platform*, which could not have come at a better time given the current circumstances.

The global pandemic has forced many people to swiftly adapt to a life of working, studying and socializing remotely. So far this meant video conferencing has become a primary mode of communication ([a boon for companies such as Zoom](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zoom-microsoft-cloud-usage-are-rocketing-during-coronavirus-pandemic-new-data-show-2020-03-30)), though how effective this is as a substitute for the “real thing” is debatable. Virtual reality (and it’s close cousin augmented reality) offer an experience of ‘presence’ not possible with the traditional computing platforms most commonly used today. [This is the fundamental pitch Mark Zuckerberg made at Oculus Connect 6 in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCB_mfGmh9w&t=3179s), where he explains a primary goal of Oculus is to create “a future that defies distance” — an idea so eerily fortuitous I’m surprised I haven’t heard his name being thrown around with the numerous COVID-19-related conspiracy theories we’ve been seeing lately. In any case, the fact that Oculus is aiming to be the next computing platform is telling, and highlights a fundamental distinction between their strategy, and that of their closest competitor in the virtual reality space, Valve.

### **Low-friction is key.**

Both Oculus and Valve make HMDs (head-mounted displays), and both run digital distribution platforms serving software to be bought and used on their hardware. At present, the vast majority of this software is aimed at gamers and tech early-adopters, which makes sense given the origins of both of these companies. But while Valve has continued to make their headsets better for the gaming market, Oculus has been gradually pivoting their hardware away from it’s PC-reliant roots. The first generation of headsets required both a powerful PC, and external tracking beacons to produce a convincing, six-degrees-of-freedom (room-scale) experience — and this is still the case for Valve’s latest — the Index (albeit with more accurate tracking, higher display refresh-rates and a larger field-of-view).

In contrast, Oculus has traded the tracking accuracy afforded by external beacons for the “good-enough” approach of integrated tracking cameras, simplifying the set-up experience significantly. While Valve’s flagship headset still requires a beefy gaming PC to work, the Oculus Quest headset relies on integrated mobile hardware, removing the need for a PC entirely. Again, this represents a trade-off — the processor is much less powerful, but it opens up the ability for the headset to work almost anywhere wirelessly. More importantly for Facebook, it expands the potential consumer base significantly — a clear priority, repeatedly mentioned during Oculus Connect.

These hardware trade-offs all result in one major advantage for Oculus — *reducing friction*. You put the headset on, and it turns on immediately. You can be standing, sitting, lying in bed, it doesn’t matter — the headset senses you are wearing it and switches on immediately, no cables to plug in or PC to boot up. Recently they even updated the software so you don’t need to use the bundled controllers to navigate the interface, a potential point of friction for users unfamiliar with the buttons, thumb-sticks and triggers commonly featured on game controllers. Instead, the headset recognizes your hands automatically, and you can browse the web, watch videos, and in the near future, play certain games without ever touching the controllers. The aim to reduce friction is a strategy that ensures the product is *accessible to the broadest demographic* possible, and it has worked wonders for companies such as Apple (the iPod, iPhone and AirPods), Amazon (Alexa, Kindle), and perhaps most recently, Zoom (with their popular, no-install video conferencing platform), just to name a few. These products are *simple to use by design*, and as a result they have each become ubiquitous.

### **Cheaper, Lighter, Faster.**

Creating a new computing platform is not easy, even if you have billions to pour into the project (just ask Microsoft and their disastrous Windows Phone operating system). At the core of this is a chicken-and-egg problem. To entice consumers into buying your hardware, you need great software and experiences — but to attract the developers needed to build this software, you need a large active consumer base. For years VR has struggled with this problem (and it arguably still is struggling), but Oculus appears to have finally overcome the hurdle somewhat. The all-in-one Oculus Quest costs $399, a far-cry from the $999 Valve Index which also requires a gaming PC to use. The Quest features a large library of software available for purchase, [has sold over $100 million worth of games and apps in its first year](https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-quest-app-revenue-100-million-sales-first-year/) (a great sign for developers) and the headsets are selling “as fast as [they] can make them”, [according to Mark Zuckerberg, himself](https://investor.fb.com/investor-events/event-details/2019/Facebook-Q2-2019-Earnings/default.aspx).

Oculus is rumored to be releasing an updated version of the Quest headset at some point in 2020 (though now likely to be in 2021, given the global pandemic), with improvements focusing on primarily on comfort. This is the trajectory they need to stay on if they want this new platform to succeed. The next, and future Quest’s [will get increasingly small, light and more comfortable](https://www.oculus.com/blog/half-dome-updates-frl-explores-more-comfortable-compact-vr-prototypes-for-work/). Many of the most popular games in VR (and crucially, those with the broadest appeal) such as Beat Saber have users sweating within half an hour of use. VR is fundamentally a more active experience, and so while Oculus was ahead of the curve by axing the tether to the PC (the wireless experience is much more comfortable and user-friendly), the faster they get to their projected future light-weight, glasses-like form-factor, the better — even if this means sticking with lower-powered processing in the short-term.

Increasing comfort and lowering the barrier to entry will result in increased consumer interest and increased sales, therefore producing economies of scale which will result in lower prices (not to mention the potential for new streams of data collection and advertising revenue for Facebook — a somewhat worrying topic I will cover in a future article). Lower prices tend to equal more consumers, which tend to equal more (and better) software. The announcement of new productivity-focused applications clearly suggest Oculus has its eye on much broader use-cases for their VR platform, but these improvements in comfort can not come quickly enough.
