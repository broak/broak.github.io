## *Tim Apple, I’m looking at you*

This morning, [Oculus (a division of Facebook) announced a policy change](https://twitter.com/oculus/status/1295769648470753281?s=20) which will require new VR users to log in using their Facebook accounts, and existing users to log in by 2023, or face losing functionality.

And the internet has responded… [poorly](https://gizmodo.com/facebook-just-told-oculus-users-to-go-get-fucked-1844765573).

While the official line was that the policy change would be beneficial because it would “make it easier to find, connect, and play with friends in VR”, people called out the move for [what it clearly is](https://twitter.com/Grummz/status/1295903777359192064?s=20) — a move to ensure the data collected from users in VR is more reliably tied to Facebook’s [enormous social-graph](https://www.businessinsider.com/explainer-what-exactly-is-the-social-graph-2012-3?op=1).

While other companies exist in the VR space (such as Valve, HTC, and HP, among others) Facebook is current the only major company offering a stand-alone headset, meaning you do not need to own a beefy PC to use it. This is an *extremely important* distinction to make, because while other headsets may be more technically capable, they also cost up to three times as much, and that is without taking into account the price of a gaming computer.

For the vast majority of the public, the Oculus Quest is the only viable option to get into VR at a reasonable price, and with little technical know-how. Facebook knows this, and so while there are no viable competitors in the stand-alone VR space, they can risk alienating their consumer base with moves like this, because after all, *where else are you going to go*?

### A privacy-focused alternative

[Two weeks ago I wrote about](https://medium.com/@broak/vr-and-ar-tech-is-headed-down-a-dark-path-a242bd6c6ea5?source=friends_link&sk=5562cc30009ffa286b091fa76132c996) the concerns I have for VR if businesses like Facebook continue to focus on treating their users not as customers, but as sources of data for advertisers. A hypothetical future Oculus Quest might gather so much bio-metric and behavioral data that it could make Facebook’s current recommendation and ad-serving algorithms look antiquated by comparison. This is the future that would likely eventuate if no privacy-focused competitor to the Quest arrives in the short term.

*But what if there was another option?*

At it’s core, the Oculus Quest is an Android-powered smartphone you strap to your face. It features a battery, ARM-based processor, internal storage, a display, cameras and some WiFi and Bluetooth modules. What separates the Quest from the smartphone world (other than its form-factor) is that if you want to play VR games on a stand-alone VR headset, your only option is to buy a headset from Facebook.

The obvious company to make a competitor for the Quest would be Apple — and [there is](https://www.roadtovr.com/apple-ar-vr-job-listings-new-products/) [evidence](https://vrscout.com/news/apple-patent-mr-headset-retina-projection/) [they are](https://www.roadtovr.com/apple-magic-leaps-former-employees/) [well on](https://www.roadtovr.com/report-apple-nextvr-acqusition/) [their way](https://www.roadtovr.com/report-apple-acquires-motion-capture-firm-ikinema/) towards announcing one. They have a long history of focusing on consumer privacy, and have completely rejected using ad-based business models for any of their products. They also pride themselves on their design and ease-of-use, which is a major selling point of the Quest. Most importantly, however, is Apple’s track-record for building reliable hardware and well-supported app ecosystems. Just as games and apps are routinely ported between iOS and Android in the phone world, so too would we likely see stand-alone VR games ported to a future Apple-made VR headset. They have even started making moves into the gaming space with their Apple Arcade subscription service, which hosts hundreds of games exclusive to the iOS platform.

There will be downsides. A headset that doesn’t rely on selling data and serving ads will likely cost more. But what is important is that consumers have *options*. I’m not saying that Apple is the *only* company capable of competing with Facebook in standalone VR, but if users want a privacy-focused alternative sooner rather than later, they *might be our best bet*.
