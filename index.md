## _I'm on track to complete my PhD by the end of 2020_

I'm a computational neuroscientist by training, with a background in psychology and human physiology. I'm interested in data science, emerging XR technology and education.

### Work Experience:

#### PhD Scholar - Neural Data Scientist - Monash University
#### _2017-2020 (Ongoing)_
Developed custom software for time-series neural data analysis and visualization for our computational vision neuroscience laboratory, as well as developed pipelines for processing large amounts of data on supercomputing clusters. Presented at multiple meetings and conferences, effectively translating complex neurophysiological, statistical and mathematical concepts for a range of audiences. Supervised an Honours student working on understanding how multivariate visual stimuli are represented in the frequency specific neural activity in cortex.

#### Teaching Associate - Monash University
#### _2017-2020_
Ran labs, tutorials and workshops for undergraduate medicine, physiology and biomedical science students, with a focus on sensory, systems, and computational neuroscience.

#### Genius Admin - Apple Inc. (Chadstone Store)
#### _2012-2017_
Worked in a small admin team to manage inventory of tools and repair/replacement parts, the allocation and prioritization of repairs, and the contact of customers regarding updates and delays, as well as being the point of call during escalations or technical issues. Developed new auditing pipelines which reduced part count errors and increased productivity by optimizing repetitive daily tasks.

### Education:

#### Doctor of Philosophy - Computational Neuroscience
#### _2017-2020 (Ongoing)_
My thesis aims to characterise the computations occurring between and within directly connected areas of primate visual cortex using a combination of electrophysiological and computational techniques. Developed custom analysis software which uses high-performance super-computing clusters to clean, sort and analyse large time-series neural datasets.

#### Bachelor of Science (Honours) - Psychology and Human Physiology
#### _2013-2016 (Ongoing)_
My honours thesis characterised the neuronal activity representing motion direction changes in visual stimuli. My undergraduate majors in Psychology and Physiology primarily focused on neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and statistics.
