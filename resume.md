## Biography

<br>
I'm a computational neuroscientist by training, where I specialise in performing time-series analyses of complex neural data. In my research, I'm interested in how visual information is encoded and transformed within the brain, and more broadly, how interconnected cortical areas communicate in an efficient and selective manner. *Basically*, I want to know how our brains generate our visual perception of the world around us.

While working on my research project, I teach undergraduate neuroscience and biomedical science, religiously follow tech and business news, and endlessly listen to podcasts and audiobooks (much to my partner's dismay!). I'm also obsessed with virtual and augmented reality, and own more headsets than I know what to do with.

I will finish my PhD in 2020, and I aim to work on a project that really gets me into a [flow state](http://positivepsychology.org.uk/living-in-flow), in a data science or analytics role after receiving my doctorate.

## Work Experience

<br>
***PhD Scholar - Neural Data Scientist***<br>
***Full Time - Monash University - 2017-2020 (ongoing)***<br>
<br>
Developed custom software for time-series neural data analysis and visualise hypothesis-driven metrics as a member of the Brain Networks and Behaviour laboratory. I also developed pipelines for processing many terabytes of data using supercomputing clusters. I effectively translated complex neurophysiological, statistical and mathematical concepts for a range of audiences. I have communicated my findings to world experts at numerous meetings and conferences, and performed public outreach during National Science Week 2018, giving a public talk about visual illusions and neural processing.

<br>
<br>
***Teaching Associate***<br>
***Seasonal - Monash University - 2017-2020***<br>
<br>
Here I ran labs, tutorials and workshops for undergraduate medicine, physiology and biomedical science students. Throughout my time teaching, I effectively translated complex concepts into a digestible form, while focusing on maintaining students' interest and building rapport. I received consistently high praise for my teaching and communication style during student evaluations.

<br>
<br>
***Genius Admin***<br>
***Part Time - Apple Retail - 2012-2017***<br>
<br>
Worked in a small admin team to manage inventory, allocation and prioritization of repairs, and the contact of customers regarding updates and delays, as well as being the point of call during escalations or technical issues. Developed new auditing pipelines which reduced part count errors and increased productivity by optimizing repetitive daily tasks.

## Education

<br>
***Doctor of Philosophy - Computational Neuroscience***<br>
***Monash University - 2017-2020 (ongoing)***<br>
<br>
My doctoral thesis characterises the computations occurring between and within directly connected areas of primate visual cortex using a combination of electrophysiological and computational techniques. Developed custom analysis software which uses high-performance super-computing clusters to clean, sort and analyse large time-series neural datasets.

<br>
<br>
***Bachelor of Science (Honours) - Psychology, Human Physiology***<br>
***Monash University - 2013-2016***<br>
<br>
My honours thesis characterised the neuronal activity representing motion direction changes in visual stimuli. My co-majors in psychology and human physiology involved training in statistical analyses, scientific report writing, and critical thinking, among domain-specific knowledge. Graduated with high distinction.

<br>
<br>
***Bachelor of Film and Television - Film Production, Digital Media Design***<br>
***Swinburne University - 2010-2012***<br>
<br>
Studied Film and Television production, with a focus on producing and editing roles. My minor in digital media design included experience with graphic design, animation and web development.
