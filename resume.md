## Biography

<br>
I currently live and work in Melbourne, Victoria.

I'm a computational neuroscientist by training, specialising in the development of custom analytical software for time-series analyses of complex neural data on supercomputing clusters. While working on my thesis project, I teach undergraduate neuroscience and biomedical science, routinely follow the latest tech and business news, and endlessly listen to podcasts and audiobooks. I'm also obsessed with virtual and augmented reality, and I strongly believe emerging technologies such as VR and AR will be instrumental in democratising future innovation and access to information, particularly for disadvantaged and underserved demographics. Having grown up in rural Australia myself, I am passionate about ensuring future generations have equal access to opportunities, regardless of their circumstances.

I will finish my PhD in 2020 and I aim work in the tech or business sector in a data science role after receiving my doctorate, where I can have a meaningful, positive impact on how people live and work using the analytical and communication skills I have developed over the last 10 years.

## Work Experience

<br>
***PhD Scholar - Neural Data Scientist***<br>
***Full Time - Monash University - 2017-2020 (ongoing)***<br>
<br>
Developed custom software for analysis of time-series, visualising metrics, and processing pipelines to analyse terabytes of data using supercomputing clusters. As a member of the Brain Networks and Behaviour laboratory, I effectively translated complex neurophysiological, statistical and mathematical concepts for a range of audiences. I have communicated my findings to world experts at numerous meetings and conferences, and performed public outreach during National Science Week 2018, giving a public talk about visual illusions and neural processing.

<br>
<br>
***Teaching Associate***<br>
***Seasonal - Monash University - 2017-2020***<br>
<br>
Lead labs, tutorials and workshops for undergraduate medicine, physiology and biomedical science students. Effectively translated complex concepts into a digestible form, while focusing on maintaining students' interest and building rapport. Received consistently high praise for my teaching and communication style during student and mentor evaluations.

<br>
<br>
***Genius Admin***<br>
***Part Time - Apple Retail - 2012-2017***<br>
<br>
Developed novel auditing pipelines which reduced part count errors and increased productivity by optimizing repetitive daily tasks, effectively saving 2 hours per day. Worked in a small admin team to manage inventory, allocation and prioritization of repairs, and the contact of customers regarding updates and delays, as well as being the point of call during escalations or technical issues.

## Education

<br>
***Doctor of Philosophy - Computational Neuroscience***<br>
***Monash University - 2017-2020 (ongoing)***<br>
<br>
My doctoral thesis characterises the computations occurring between and within directly connected areas of primate visual cortex using a combination of electrophysiological and computational techniques. Developed custom analysis software which uses high-performance super-computing clusters to clean, sort and analyse large time-series neural datasets, as well as producing visualisations for gaining meaningful insights from complex, multidimensional data.

<br>
<br>
***Bachelor of Science (Honours) - Psychology, Human Physiology***<br>
***Monash University - 2013-2016***<br>
<br>
My honours thesis characterised the neuronal activity representing motion direction changes in visual stimuli. My co-majors in psychology and human physiology involved training in statistical analyses, scientific report writing, and critical thinking, among domain-specific knowledge. Graduated with high distinction.

<br>
<br>
***Bachelor of Film and Television - Film Production, Digital Media Design***<br>
***Swinburne University - 2010-2012***<br>
<br>
Studied Film and Television production, with a focus on producing and editing roles. My minor in digital media design included experience with graphic design, animation and web development.
