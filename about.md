<br>
**I'm a computational neuroscientist by training, where I specialise in performing time-series analyses of complex neural data. In my research, I'm interested in how visual information is encoded and transformed within the brain, and more broadly, how interconnected cortical areas communicate in an efficient and selective manner.<br>
<br>
*Basically*, I want to know how our brains generate our visual perception of the world around us.**<br>

## What Worries Me
- The seemingly never-ending [expansion of surveillance capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism).
- We are living in a [post-truth world](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36702245-post-truth), and [it's our own fault](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030763-000-free-speech-has-met-social-media-with-revolutionary-results/).
- COVID is [accelerating societal changes](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-is-accelerating-big-changes-in-the-way-americans-live-2020-03-12) faster than we can prepare for.

## Why I'm Still *Somewhat* Hopeful for the Future
- Tech will [continue to democratize access to information](https://www.brookings.edu/research/education-technology-success-stories/) (opportunity will continue to equalise).
- Future generations may become (relatively) [immune to misinformation](https://futurism.com/google-teach-kids-spot-fake-news) as a result of growing up with the internet, and the torrents of nonsense online. Humans tend to be good at adapting.
- Increasing acceptance of remote work and [work-from-home could be a boon to previously underserved communities](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/510123-googles-work-from-home-extension-could-be-a-boon-for-rural-america).

#### Books:
- **[Why We're Polarised](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52098718-why-we-re-polarized)** - *Ezra Klein*
    - *-Currently reading-* Liking it so far...
- **[How to Raise Successful People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40796147-how-to-raise-successful-people)** - *Esther Wojcicki*
    - Haven't yet decided if I want kids, but thought I might as well be ready in case I do. Esther Wojcicki describes a parenting model quite different to the one I experienced growing up. Interesting read.
- **[Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits)** - *James Clear*
    - Needed this immensely, and will likely come back to it again. Basically cognitive behavioural therapy, but less scary sounding.

    - A lot of machine learning literature summarised in 2-5 minutes. Like wonderful little video abstracts.
- **[DARK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_(TV_series))** - *Netflix*
    - German series about time travel. Need to keep notes, and binge the entire thing, otherwise you'll be horribly confused. The complexity is what makes it fascinating.
- **[The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series))** - *Amazon Prime Video*
    - Series about the political struggles of humanity after generations living in distant colonies around the solar system. Season 1 is a bit rough but 2, 3 and 4 make it worth a watch.
