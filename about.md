<br>
I'm a computational neuroscientist by training, where I specialise in performing time-series analyses of complex neural data. In my research, I'm interested in how visual information is encoded and transformed within the brain, and more broadly, how interconnected cortical areas communicate in an efficient and selective manner.<br>
<br>
*Basically*, I want to know how our brains generate our visual perception of the world around us.<br>

## What Worries Me
- The seemingly never-ending expansion of surveillance capitalism.
- We are living in a post-truth world, and it's our own fault.
- COVID is accelerating societal changes faster than we can predict/counter.

## Why I'm Still (Somewhat) Hopeful for the Future
- Tech will continue to democratize access to information (opportunity will continue to equalise).
- Future generations may become (relatively) immune to misinformation as a result of being constantly bombarded with nonsense. Humans tend to be good at adapting.
- Increasing acceptance of remote work and work-from-home will be a boon to previously underprivileged demographics.
